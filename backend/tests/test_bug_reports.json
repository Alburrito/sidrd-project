There shouldn't be any extra work required in this bug to account for that since we go through the `input.pickElement` path, but I mention it just in case.\n\nOne other thing is that `FX_URLBAR_SELECTED_RESULT_TYPE` doesn't distinguish between picks of the tip's main button vs. its help button though.

          "raw_text": "(In reply to Marco Bonardo [:mak] from comment #10)\n> Do we care about the tip being interacted with?\n\nWe currently record tip picks as part of the `FX_URLBAR_SELECTED_RESULT_TYPE` enumerated histogram (tips are recorded as value `12`), plus the `FX_URLBAR_SELECTED_RESULT_INDEX` and `FX_URLBAR_SELECTED_RESULT_INDEX_BY_TYPE` histograms. That's in addition to the event telemetry, which isn't enabled by default of course.\n\nSo it seems like the only thing we might need here is a histogram for shown count, if we want that.\n\nAlso note that now that bug 1611873 is landed, we treat focusing/selecting the urlbar while a search tip is showing as picking the tip. There shouldn't be any extra work required in this bug to account for that since we go through the `input.pickElement` path, but I mention it just in case.\n\nOne other thing is that `FX_URLBAR_SELECTED_RESULT_TYPE` doesn't distinguish between picks of the tip's main button vs. its help button though. That's not relevant for search tips since they don't show a help button, but it is relevant for interventions.",

Are they being interacted with?\n\n2) Why does Mozilla need to answer these questions?  Are there benefits for users? Do we need this information to address product or business requirements? Some example responses:\n- Determine if these new features are serving their purpose and are worth continued investment.\n\n3) What alternative methods did you consider to answer these questions? Why were they not sufficient?\n- Collecting the total number of Tips seen. This was not sufficient since we had no way of distinguishing Search Tips and Interventions in this data nor could we measure interaction with these features.\n\n4) Can current instrumentation answer these questions?\n- No. See question 3.\n\n5) List all proposed measurements and indicate the category of data collection for each measurement, using the [Firefox data collection categories](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection) found on the Mozilla wiki.   \n\nMeasurements:\nbrowser.urlbar.tip_name_count - Category 1 - Measures how many and what types of Search Tips are seen by a user.\n\nbrowser.urlbar.intervention_name_count - Category 1 - Measures how many and what types of Interventions are seen by a user.\n\nbrowser.urlbar.intervention_name_button_picked - Category 1 - Measures how many and what types of Interventions are interacted with.\n\nbrowser.urlbar.intervention_name_help_picked - Category 1 - Measures on what types of interventions the Help button is clicked.\n\n6) How long will this data be collected?  Choose one of the following:\n- I’d like for the Search Data Science team (Teon Brooks, Ben Miroglio) to permanently monitor this data.\n\n7) What populations will you measure?\n\n- All countries, release channels, and locales that Interventions and Search Tips are enabled in. For Interventions, this is currently early Beta, all countries, but only EN locales. For Search Tips this is currently early Beta, all countries, and all locales. It is expected that these features will eventually be available in all locales in all release channels.\n\n8) If this data collection is default on, what is the opt-out mechanism for users?\n- Standard telemetry opt-out.\n\n\nThese are probably best answered by the Search Data Science team:\n\n9) Please provide a general description of how you will analyze this data.\n\n10) Where do you intend to share the results of your analysis?\n\n11) Is there a third-party tool (i.e. not Telemetry) that you are proposing to use for this data collection?",

Are they being interacted with?\n\n2) Why does Mozilla need to answer these questions?  Are there benefits for users? Do we need this information to address product or business requirements? Some example responses:\n- Determine if these new features are serving their purpose and are worth continued investment.\n\n3) What alternative methods did you consider to answer these questions? Why were they not sufficient?\n- Collecting the total number of Tips seen. This was not sufficient since we had no way of distinguishing Search Tips and Interventions in this data nor could we measure interaction with these features.\n\n4) Can current instrumentation answer these questions?\n- No. See question 3.\n\n5) List all proposed measurements and indicate the category of data collection for each measurement, using the [Firefox data collection categories](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection) found on the Mozilla wiki.   \n\nMeasurements:\nbrowser.urlbar.tip_name_count - Category 1 - Measures how many and what types of Search Tips are seen by a user.\n\nbrowser.urlbar.intervention_name_count - Category 1 - Measures how many and what types of Interventions are seen by a user.\n\nbrowser.urlbar.intervention_name_button_picked - Category 1 - Measures how many and what types of Interventions are interacted with.\n\nbrowser.urlbar.intervention_name_help_picked - Category 1 - Measures on what types of interventions the Help button is clicked.\n\n6) How long will this data be collected?  Choose one of the following:\n- I’d like for the Search Data Science team (Teon Brooks, Ben Miroglio) to permanently monitor this data.\n\n7) What populations will you measure?\n\n- All countries, release channels, and locales that Interventions and Search Tips are enabled in. For Interventions, this is currently early Beta, all countries, but only EN locales. For Search Tips this is currently early Beta, all countries, and all locales. It is expected that these features will eventually be available in all locales in all release channels.\n\n8) If this data collection is default on, what is the opt-out mechanism for users?\n- Standard telemetry opt-out.\n\n\nThese are probably best answered by the Search Data Science team:\n\n9) Please provide a general description of how you will analyze this data.\n\n10) Where do you intend to share the results of your analysis?\n\n11) Is there a third-party tool (i.e. not Telemetry) that you are proposing to use for this data collection?",
